This is a repository containing the code for our game FOOOORE! for the Pirate Software Game Jam 2025
This game is a 3D platforming game where you control a golfball who must ricochet of unsuspecting golfers to make your way into the hole. All you get is your first shot, unless you're able to hit a golfer, where you will then be granted a mid-air swing to continue your path. Aim for the fastest times and least swings as you bounce your way through each level.
